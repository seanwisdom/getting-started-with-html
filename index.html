    <h1>Project 0 - Notes from Lesson 1</h1>
The <b>internet</b> is a collection of servers that communicate via the protocol <em>HTTP</em>.  &nbspThe internet is accessed from a personal computer through a browser.<br><br>
<strong>HTML</strong> is short for <em>Hypertext Mark Up Language</em> and is the language most commonly used to write code for web pages.  <br>
<p>The key component of HTML is an <em>element</em>.  &nbspAn element is opened and closed by a <em>tag</em>.</p>
Elements are classified as either <em>inline</em> or <b>block</b>.  <br>
<p>A tag can also have an attribute. &nbspFor example, the anchor tag uses the <em>href</em> attribute to set the target of the anchor.  </p>
Following this <a href=www.google.com>link</a> will take you to a search engine that you could use to search for other examples of attributes.<br>
